= Doppelganger Loads

This thesis revolves around implementing doppelganger loads in hardware.
This chapter presents doppelganger loads, how they are implemented, how they do not change the safety guarantees of secure speculation, and how they improve performance.
At its core, doppelganger loads attempt to regain some of the MLP that is lost when applying secure speculation schemes @bib:doppelganger.
