== Memory, Caches, and Consistency

For hardware to perform well, it needs fast access to memory.
Main memory technologies like DRAM are optimised for capacity at the cost of _bandwidth_ and latency with latency being the biggest killer of performance.
Even though in-order processors can finish executing one instruction per cycle, this is only in theory and long-latency memory instructions 

Very early processors were 

=== Caches

=== Cache Prefetching
