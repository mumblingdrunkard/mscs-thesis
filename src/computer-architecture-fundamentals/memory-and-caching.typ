== Interlude: Memory, Caches, and Consistency

For hardware to perform well, it needs fast access to memory.
Main memory technologies like DRAM are optimised for capacity at the cost of _bandwidth_ and latency with latency being the biggest killer of performance.
Even though superscalar processors can finish more than one instruction per cycle, this is only in theory.
Long latency memory instructions will cause the processor to halt, and has a disproportionate impact on performance.

=== Cache Prefetching
