Thank you to my supervisors Magnus Sj√§lander and Amund Bergland Kvalsvik.
You have both provided valuable input to this project.
Amund has contributed especially towards the practical execution of the project with valuable knowledge about the development process of the BOOM project and various tooling around it.
Magnus is always an interesting sparring partner when discussing various concepts and reasoning about them and has been willing to listen to ideas and always has something valuable to contribute at the end.

Thank you both for keeping me on track to finish this project with something deliverable.

Thanks to the NTNU IDUN computer cluster for providing the countless CPU-hours spent on this project.
Sorry for running compilations and simulations on the login node by mistake even though I never received a complaint by email.

Finally, thank you to myself, for seeing it through despite plenty of personal challenges and blockers this semester.
You are not really used to life being this rough, but you steeled yourself and actually delivered something.
I am proud of you.
